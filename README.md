# Casino Simulation
The casino simulation semester-long project for Application Programming Concepts (Summer 2019).

This reposistory will serve as a copy of what I worked on for this project, namely for employers.

The roulette.py file wll not work standalone, you will need all the other games and the main file to run the simulation
which can be found down below. 

The group reposiotry lives here https://github.com/wochoa98/APCCASINO2019
